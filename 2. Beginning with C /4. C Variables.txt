Variables in C 

1. **What is a Variable?**
  - A variable is a named storage location in the computer's memory where data can be stored and manipulated.
  - It has a unique identifier (name) that is used to refer to it within the program.

2. **Rules to Declare Variables**:
  - Variable names must start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore `_`.
  - Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, or underscores.
  - Variable names are case-sensitive.
  - Variable names should not be keywords or reserved words.
  - Variable names should be meaningful and descriptive.


3. **Variable Declaration**:
  - It is the process of informing the compiler about the data type and name of the variable.
  - Example:
    ```c
    int count;
    float price;
    char letter;
    ```

4. **Variable Definition**:
  - A variable definition allocates memory space for the variable and associates a name with it.
  - It includes both declaration and initialization.
  - Example:
    ```c
    int count = 0;
    float price = 10.99;
    char letter = 'A';
    ```

5. **Variable Initialization**:
  - Initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of its declaration.
  - It is optional, but recommended to avoid using uninitialized variables.
  - Example:
    ```c
    int count = 0;
    ```

6. **Types of Variables**:
  I. **Local Variables**:
     - Declared inside a function or a block.
     - Their scope is limited to the block or function in which they are declared.
     - Example:
       ```c
       void function() {
           int local_variable;
           // code
       }
       ```

  II. **Global Variables**:
     - Declared outside of all functions.
     - Can be accessed and modified by any function in the program.
     - Example:
       ```c
       int global_variable;
       void function() {
           // code
       }
       ```

  III. **Static Variables**:
     - Retain their value between function calls.
     - Declared using the `static` keyword.
     - Example:
       ```c
       void function() {
           static int static_variable = 0;
           // code
       }
       ```

  IV. **Automatic (or Local) Variables**:
     - Variables declared inside a function without the `static` keyword.
     - Their memory is allocated when the function is called and deallocated when the function exits.
     - Example:
       ```c
       void function() {
           int automatic_variable;
           // code
       }
       ```

  V. **Extern Variables**:
     - Variables declared in one file and used in another file.
     - Declared using the `extern` keyword in the file where it is used.
     - Example:
       ```c
       // File: file1.c
       int extern_variable;

       // File: file2.c
       extern int extern_variable;
       ```

  VI. **Register Variables**:
     - Variables declared using the `register` keyword.
     - Suggests to the compiler to store the variable in a CPU register for faster access.
     - Example:
       ```c
       register int register_variable;
       ```

7. **Variable Scope**:
  - Scope refers to the region of the program where a variable can be accessed.
  - Variables can have local scope (limited to a block or function) or global scope (accessible throughout the program).
  - Example:
    ```c
    int global_variable; // Global variable
    void function() {
        int local_variable; // Local variable
        // code
    }
    ```
