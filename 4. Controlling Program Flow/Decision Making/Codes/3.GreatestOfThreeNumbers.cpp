/*
Problem statement -Program to find the Greatest of Three Numbers 
*/

/* Method 1 - using if else statement
Algorithm - For user inputs of numbers as first, second and third.
Step 1: Check if first number is greater than second and third, Print first is the greatest
Step 2: Check if second number is greater than first and third, Print second is the greatest
Step 3: Third number has to be greatest, Print third is the greatest
*/

/*
Algorithm 1 - 
1. Start 
2. Declare variables first, second, third 
3. Read values of first, second, third
4. if first > second 
      if first > third : Display first as greatest 
      else : display third as greatest
    else 
       if  second > third : Display second as greatest 
       else : display third as greatest
5. Stop 
*/

/* Method 2 - using ternary operator
Algorithm - 
Step 1: Store the largest between first and second using ternary operator in variable temp
        temp = first > second ? first:second;
Step 2: Store the largest between temp and third using ternary operator in variable result
        result = temp > third ? temp:third;
Step 3: Print value of result
*/

/* Method 3 - using inbulid max function
