# Continue 
-> no further statement in the body of the loop are executed 
-> control immediately goes directly to the begining of the loop for next iteration 

# Break 
-> no further statements in the body of the loop are executed 
-> loop is immediately terminated 
-> control immediately goes to the statement following the loop construct 

# Infinite loops 
-> loops whose condition expression always evalute to true
-> usually this is unintended and a programmer error 
-> sometimes programmmers use Infinite loops & include and break statements in the body to control them 
-> sometimes infinite loops are exactly what we want
