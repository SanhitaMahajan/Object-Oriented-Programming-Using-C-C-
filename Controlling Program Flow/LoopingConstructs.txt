C++ Looping Constructs 

# For Loop 
-> iterate a specific number of times 

# Range based for loop 
-> one iteration for each elements in a range of collection 

# while loop 
-> iterate while condition remains true
->stop when condition is false
->check condition at the begining of every iteration 

# do-while loop 
-> iterate while condition is true, stop when condition is false
->check condition at the end of every iteration 
->do while loop execute at least one time 

# Infinite loop 
-> loops shose condition expression always evaluate to tru 
-> usually this is unintended and a programmer error 
-> sometimes programmers use infinite loops and include and break statement in the body to control them 
-> sometimes infinite loop are exactly what we want need 
* event loop in a event-driven program 
* operating system
